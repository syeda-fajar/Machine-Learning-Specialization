# Machine Learning Specialization by  Andrew Ng (Coursera)

This repository contains the labs and assignments completed as part of the **Machine Learning Specialization**, offered by **DeepLearning.AI** in collaboration with **Stanford Online**. This specialization is an updated version of Andrew Ngâ€™s pioneering Machine Learning course, and it focuses on practical applications of machine learning to real-world AI tasks.

## Program Overview

The **Machine Learning Specialization** is a comprehensive, beginner-friendly program designed to teach the fundamentals of machine learning. It covers both **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques and emphasizes best practices used by leading AI companies in Silicon Valley.

This specialization is structured into **3 courses**:

### 1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
   - Build supervised machine learning models for prediction and classification tasks.
   - Techniques include:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Regularization**
   - Use Python, **NumPy**, and **Scikit-learn** to build these models.

### 2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
   - Explore more complex supervised models, such as:
     - **Neural Networks** using **TensorFlow** for multi-class classification.
     - **Decision Trees** and **Ensemble Methods** like **Random Forests** and **Boosted Trees**.
   - Learn about model evaluation and tuning to generalize your models to new data.

### 3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**
   - Techniques for **unsupervised learning**, including:
     - **Clustering** (K-Means)
     - **Anomaly Detection**
   - Build **recommender systems** using:
     - **Collaborative Filtering**
     - **Content-based filtering** with deep learning.
   - Learn about **Reinforcement Learning** and build a deep reinforcement learning model.

## Applied Learning Project

By the end of this specialization, I was able to:
- Build machine learning models using popular libraries such as **NumPy** and **Scikit-learn**.
- Implement and train supervised machine learning models like **linear regression**, **logistic regression**, and **neural networks**.
- Apply best practices for improving model performance and ensuring that models generalize to real-world data.
- Use **decision trees** and **tree ensemble methods** (random forests, boosted trees) for complex decision-making tasks.
- Implement unsupervised learning algorithms like **clustering** and **anomaly detection**.
- Build **recommender systems** using **collaborative filtering** and **deep learning** methods.
- Develop a **deep reinforcement learning** model for AI-driven tasks.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn** for data visualization
